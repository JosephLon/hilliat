To celebrate Hacktoberfest 2018, we will all be contributing to an “open source” story! No programming required and have fun writing!

## Story Prompt
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  Write an day’s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!
