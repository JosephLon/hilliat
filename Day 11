Today was a big big day. I saw Britney Spears in public today. (Who knew she had hair again?) I wish I could grow such luscious
hair after cutting it all off. I wonder what I would look like with long blonde hair. Maybe then I'll finally be considered cool
But you know what, you are your own man. If you do it will be because YOU think it's cool bro. (Is that cool that you just 
called yourself bro? Idk man Idk). CODING IS COOOL. GITHUB CAT SHOWS UP WHEN YOU GO TO A FORBIDDEN GITHUB PAGE WHHAAAAT
